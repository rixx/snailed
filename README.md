snailed
=======

Snailed contains tools to deal with LiveSplit `.lss` data and the Splits.io data exchange format. It contains separate
compontents (sans-IO style) to do the following things:

- Read `.lss` data into a data structure
- Read Splits.io data into a data structure

Analytics to come later, possibly.

I wrote these scripts to support the [snail-me](https://github.com/rixx/snail-me) project, and I wanted the file parsing
to be reusable.
